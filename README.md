## Additional Notes

### Working with Markdown

By default, quick suggesstion is disabled for markdown files. So, to be able to use this extension in your markdown files, ensure you've enabled the quick sugesstions as below:

```json
"[markdown]":  {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": true
    },
```

> You can open your `settings.json` file and add the above code-block into the file.

### Using in Comments

If you want to use emojis in comment lines, set the `"editor.quickSuggestions.comments": true` in your `settings.json` file.

**Enjoy!** 🎉
