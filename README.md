## Working with Markdown

By default, quick suggesstion is disabled by markdown files. So, to be able to use this extension in your markdown files, ensure you've enabled the quick sugesstions as below:

```json
"[markdown]":  {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": true
    },
```

> You can open your `settings.json` file and add the above code-block into the file.

**Enjoy!**
