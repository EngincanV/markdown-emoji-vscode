# markdown-emoji README

markdown-emoji helps you easily add emojis into your file. You can use these emojis in JS, TS, Markdown, CSharp, PHP and Python (for now).

## Usage

You can download the extension from 👉 //TODO: extension marketplace url!!!

Then, start typing `::<emoji-name>` and add the emoji into your file. That's it!

## Additional Notes

### Working with Markdown

By default, quick suggesstion is disabled for markdown files. So, to be able to use this extension in your markdown files, ensure you've enabled the quick sugesstions as below:

```json
"[markdown]":  {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": true
    },
```

> You can open your `settings.json` file and add the above code-block into the file.

### Using in Comments

If you want to use emojis in comment lines, set the `"editor.quickSuggestions.comments": true` in your `settings.json` file.

**Enjoy!** 🎉
